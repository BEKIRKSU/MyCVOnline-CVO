# CVO Project

The CV Project streamlines the recruitment process by offering a one-click online method for recruiters to access CVs. This efficient approach takes them directly to the web link of a CV instead of downloading files. The project is meticulously designed for easy navigation, ensuring recruiters can quickly find the information they need in a clutter-free environment.

- **Additional Media Options:** Multimedia features provide recruiters with a better understanding of candidates beyond textual information.

## For Applicants

- **Ready-Made Design:** The CV's ready-made design eliminates the need for intricate formatting, allowing applicants to focus on content.
- **No Page Limit Worries:** Applicants don't need to worry about the number of pages; recruiters can selectively view sections of interest.
